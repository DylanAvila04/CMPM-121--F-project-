# Devlog Entry – Week 1

## Introducing the team
Tools Lead – Dylan
I’m responsible for researching alternative tools, helping everyone get their machines set up, and establishing basic guidelines for code style and workflow. I'll help support tasks like version control setup and any automated formatting or scripts the team needs.

Engine Lead – Charles Li 
This person will research possible engines and help the team understand how to use our chosen engine. They will also help organize where different types of code should live and propose structure that keeps the game code clean and manageable.

Design Lead – Aiden Le
This teammate leads the creative direction of the game — look, feel, tone, and core gameplay ideas. They will create mockups, sample assets, and help guide how the game presents its world and mechanics.

Testing Lead – Dylan Avila
This person will take responsibility for automated testing within the project, along with organizing and reporting from team playtests.
## Tools and materials
    1. Engine
    We plan on using the baseline web browser platform (HTML/CSS/TypeScript) along with a lightweight rendering library if needed. This lets us build something playable in the browser without requiring complex 3D rendering or physics. Using a simple engine also keeps development accessible to all members of the team regardless of their background.

    2. Language
    We’ll be using TypeScript as our primary programming language. Our team already has experience with it from prior assignments, and it fits naturally with the web-based engine. For storing game data such as item lists, stats, or level information, we’ll be using simple JSON 
    files.

    3. Tools
    We expect to use VS Code as our main IDE because everyone on the team is familiar with it and it has strong TypeScript support. For visual assets, we might use tools like Aseprite, PixilArt, or similar pixel-art creators. For version control we’ll rely on GitHub, where our project repository will be hosted.

    4. Generative AI
    Our team will allow limited use of generative AI tools (including GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT) under specific conditions. AI tools can help with boilerplate code, debugging ideas, and explanation of concepts. However, we will avoid using agentic tools that automatically modify the codebase. Any AI-generated code must be reviewed, understood, and manually integrated by a team member.
## Outlook
    For this project, our team is hoping to create something that is polished, readable, and fun to work on. We aim to try a mechanic or design idea that other teams might not attempt, such as a unique progression system or a creative visual theme. The riskiest part will likely be coordinating our workflow and merging contributions from multiple people, but our tool choices (browser engine, TypeScript, GitHub) should help us handle that. Overall, we plan to combine solid planning with flexible tools to keep the project fun and manageable.
